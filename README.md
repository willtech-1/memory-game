## üå± Memory Game Instructions
User can click on any "empty" card in those 16 displayed on the screen.
When empty card is clicked an image will show, then user has to click another card again, if the first image card the user clicked matches with the second image card the user scores one point and both image cards will be displayed on screen.
However if not then the user will have to keep on checking to find eight cards that match.
